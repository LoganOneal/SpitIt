## Important Notes - PLEASE READ

- I am **NOT an Expert**, the code is very simple and basic, but it does work!
  - This is my first time putting a public repository on GITHUB. So please be gentle! :-)
- I'm sure there are many **improvements that can and/or** should be made.
- I'm still learning REACT/REACT-Native.
- This app is here to help people get started, up and running quickly with a working shell.
- You should be able to take the code here and just started adding screens you need for your app.
- I make **no guarantees, written, verbal or implied**.
  - If you use the code, its your job to validate and test and ensure its working as you need it to.
- I cannot provide any type of support outside of answering some quick questions.
  - I work full time and I don't have time to provide detailed support.
- I will try and keep this template updated, as and when I can, when major versions of the dependencies are changed.
